# BLOG WebSite 
(Login/Register functionality)
This is the PART 4 and finall product of my BLOG WebSite project. 
Here I implemented the Register and Login Functionality in our BLOG Website, using Python, SQLite, Flask, HTML, CSS.
The password are safely stored with encryption functionalities.
The Login state stays and the BLOG Changes in each state.
There is also an ADMIN login credentials where you gain more functionalities in the BLOG Posts of each user.
